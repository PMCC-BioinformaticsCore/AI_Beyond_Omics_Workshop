# Basics of Prompts

Whether in coding, literature search, or data analysis, a well-crafted prompt improves the relevance, accuracy, and quality of the responses. Understanding prompt basics is essential for effectively using generative AI tools, as prompts are the instructions that guide these models to produce desired outputs. By mastering prompt basics, users can communicate more clearly with AI models, setting the foundation for more advanced techniques like prompt engineering, which fine-tunes prompts to achieve even more precise results.

### What is a prompt?

A prompt is a piece of text or input given to an AI model to guide its response.

![](images/prompt.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}

-   **Role in Communication:** The prompt guides the AI by setting the tone, context, and direction of the response, ensuring the output aligns with the user's goals.
-   **Variability:** Prompts can vary in complexity, length, and style, depending on the desired result---ranging from simple questions to detailed instructions.
-   **Processing the Input:** When a generative AI model receives a prompt, it parses the language to understand the request, identifying key elements and determining the response type, which helps the AI produce relevant and accurate outputs.

### Main Types of Prompts

#### 1. Informational Prompts

These prompts ask the AI to provide background information, summaries, or explanations on a specific topic. They are fact-oriented, seeking comprehensive explanations.

![](images/info-prompt.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

#### 2. Instructional Prompts

Instructional prompts guide the AI to perform specific tasks or generate step-by-step outputs. They are task-focused, clear, with defined output goals.

![](images/inst-prompt.png){fig-align="center" width="370"}

#### 3. Query Prompts

Query prompts are used to ask specific questions, often for fact-finding or clarifying details on particular concepts or methods. They are aimed at obtaining quick, straightforward answers.

![](images/query-prompt.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing prompts strategically to achieve precise and relevant outputs from an AI model. By structuring prompts with clear instructions, relevant context, and guiding cues, users can enhance the quality and specificity of AI responses. In bioinformatics, this technique can be used to produce targeted outputs for coding, data analysis, literature summarization, and more.

Five Key Principles of Prompt Engineering:

1.  Giving Instructions
2.  Direct the Models Focus with Primary Content
3.  Providing Examples
4.  Priming the Output with Cues
5.  Evaluate Output Quality

### 1. Giving Clear Instructions

Instructions direct the AI model on what action to perform, from simple tasks to complex, multi-step requests. The level of detail in instructions impacts the model's ability to meet specific needs.

-   

    #### Less Effective Prompt:

    Summarize the meeting notes.

-   

    #### More Effective Prompt:

    Summarize the meeting notes in a single paragraph. Then list the speakers with each of their key points. Finally, outline any next steps or action items suggested by the speakers.

### 2. Direct the Models Focus with Primary Content

Primary content specifies the main body of text the model is expected to process or transform. When combined with instructions, it helps the AI concentrate on the essential elements of the task.

### 3. Providing Examples

Examples improve the model's response accuracy and relevance by setting a template for the desired output. They help 'condition' the AI, especially when demonstrating specific types of responses or styles.

-   

    #### Less Effective Prompt:

    Create a comprehensive report on the implementation of a new electronic health records (EHR) system.

-   

    #### More Effective Prompt:

    Create a comprehensive report on the implementation of a new electronic health records (EHR) system in a mid-sized hospital. For instance, describe how the project team managed budget constraints while ensuring system efficiency, similar to how the XYZ Hospital project was handled."

### 4. Priming with Cues

Cues serve as starting points or 'jumpstarts' for the AI's response, setting up the output structure. They help guide the model toward the desired format and flow.

-   

    #### Example Cue:

    In 5 concise points, summarize...

### 5. Evaluate Output Quality

Assessing the AI's output is crucial to ensure accuracy and usability. Key questions to consider include:

-   Is the information correct and relevant?
-   Is the output unbiased?
-   Is the response clear and suitable for the intended purpose?
-   Could refining the prompt improve the result?

### Pulling It All Together

Combining all elements---clear instructions, focused content, examples, and cues---leads to a well-engineered prompt that yields high-quality output.

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

Advanced prompting techniques allow users to communicate more effectively with AI models, leading to more accurate and tailored responses. These strategies can help ensure that the model processes complex requests accurately, provides clear reasoning, and handles repetitive tasks efficiently.

-   

    ### Give the Model a Role

    Assigning a role to the model at the beginning of the prompt encourages it to respond in a manner consistent with that role. By setting a specific role, such as "data analyst," "teacher," or "research assistant," the model can better align its responses with the expected expertise or perspective.

![](images/role-model.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

-   

    ### Specify Steps to Complete the Task

    For tasks that require multiple actions, break down the process into clear, sequential steps. Using bullet points or numbered lists improves clarity, helping the model execute each step in the correct order.

![](images/task-steps.png){fig-align="center" width="370"}

-   

    ### Indicate Distinct Parts of Your Prompt

    Dividing your prompt into sections or labeled parts helps the model focus on each component of the request. Adding section titles or ordered steps clarifies the output structure and ensures the response covers all aspects of the prompt.

![](images/parts-prompt.png){fig-align="center" width="370"}

-   

    ### Chain of Thought Prompting

    Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting instructs the model to follow a logical, step-by-step reasoning process. This technique is particularly helpful for complex problem-solving tasks, as it allows the model to "think aloud" and process each step methodically, improving transparency and reducing errors.\
    \
    **Example CoT Prompts:**\

    -   "Explain this concept step-by-step."\
    -   "Break down the reasoning behind each answer."\
    -   "Imagine you're teaching this to someone new. Explain each step in detail."\
    -   "Consider each part separately and explain your approach."\
    -   "What assumptions are being made? Walk me through your thought process."

![](images/cot.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

-   

    ### Get the Cleanest Responses

    To maximize output quality, consider specifying the desired length and style of the response. Use concise language to avoid unnecessary verbosity, and remember token limits, which cap the length of the model's response.\
    \
    **Tips for Clear Responses:** \
    - Specify output length: "Summarize in three sentences." \
    - Request concise responses: "Answer briefly." \
    - Understand token limits to avoid overly long or cut-off responses.

-   

    ### Breaking Down Complex Tasks

    Complex tasks are often best handled by breaking them into smaller, manageable steps. By structuring complex prompts into simpler stages, the model can focus on one part at a time, increasing accuracy and relevance.

![](images/breakdown.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

![](images/breakdown2.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}


### Leveraging Templates for Repetitive Tasks

Using templates can help automate repetitive tasks by providing a consistent format. Templates standardize responses and save time, particularly when similar tasks must be performed multiple times.

::: callout-note
### Template Example: Email Summary

**Task:** Summarize Email \
**Content:** \[Paste the entire email content here.\]\
**Instructions:**

1. Provide a concise summary of the email. 
2. Highlight any key points or action items. 
3. Identify the sender's primary intent or purpose. 
4. Note specific dates, deadlines, or important details mentioned.
5. Mention any unclear points or ambiguities in the email. \

:::

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
### Answer

## Understanding pLDDT in Protein Structure Prediction

pLDDT, or predicted local-distance difference test, is a confidence measure used in the AlphaFold protein structure prediction system. Here are the key aspects of pLDDT:

- **Purpose**:
  - pLDDT is designed to assess the reliability of the predicted protein structure. It provides a quantitative measure of how confident the model is about the accuracy of its predictions for each residue in the protein structure.

- **Calculation**:
  - The pLDDT score is derived from the predicted local distances between Cα atoms in the protein structure. It evaluates the local accuracy of the predicted structure by comparing it to the true structure, which is essential for understanding the model's performance on a per-residue basis .

- **Interpretation**:
  - The pLDDT score ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater confidence in the accuracy of the predicted structure. A score above 70 is generally considered to indicate a reliable prediction, while scores below this threshold suggest lower confidence in the accuracy of the predicted structure.

- **Relation to lDDT-Cα**:
  - The pLDDT measure is closely related to the local-distance difference test (lDDT-Cα), which specifically focuses on the accuracy of the backbone structure. The pLDDT reliably predicts the lDDT-Cα accuracy, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the quality of protein structure predictions .

- **Application**:
  - Researchers can use pLDDT scores to prioritize which predicted structures to investigate further, as higher scores suggest that the corresponding structures are more likely to be accurate representations of the actual protein conformations.

In summary, pLDDT is a crucial metric in AlphaFold that helps researchers gauge the confidence of protein structure predictions, guiding further analysis and experimental validation.

## Calculation of pLDDT Score in AlphaFold

The pLDDT score is a critical metric in the AlphaFold protein structure prediction framework, providing insights into the confidence of the predicted structures. Here’s how the pLDDT score is calculated:

- **Local Distance Predictions**:
  - The pLDDT score is based on the predicted distances between Cα atoms in the protein structure. It evaluates how well the predicted distances align with the actual distances observed in known protein structures.

- **Per-Residue Networks**:
  - The calculation involves small per-residue networks that analyze the final activations at the end of the AlphaFold network. These networks specifically focus on predicting the local distances and angles for each residue, which are essential for determining the overall structure accuracy .

- **Error Prediction**:
  - The pLDDT score is derived from a pairwise error prediction, which is computed as a linear projection from the final pair representation of the predicted structure. This approach allows the model to estimate the local accuracy of each residue based on the predicted distances .

- **Final Score Generation**:
  - The resulting pLDDT score is then generated by aggregating the local distance predictions across the entire protein structure. This score reflects the model's confidence in the accuracy of the predicted structure for each residue, with higher scores indicating greater confidence.

- **Interpretation of Scores**:
  - The pLDDT score is typically reported on a scale from 0 to 100, where scores above 70 are generally considered reliable. This scoring system helps researchers assess which parts of the predicted structure are likely to be accurate and which may require further investigation or validation .

In summary, the pLDDT score is calculated through a combination of local distance predictions, per-residue networks, and pairwise error predictions, ultimately providing a confidence measure for the accuracy of protein structure predictions in AlphaFold.
