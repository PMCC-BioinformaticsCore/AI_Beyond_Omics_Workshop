# Overview of the Workshop

## Workshop Summary

This workshop aims to explore the broad applications of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that are relevant to bioinformaticians. The event will feature short talks where participants will present projects that demonstrate the use of AI, beyond its applications in mainstream bioinformatics. These projects may involve various AI subfields, such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, computer vision, generative AI, natural language processing, neural networks, large language models (LLMs). The workshop will include a hands-on session focused on employing generative AI tools to augment bioinformatics research with particular emphasis on literature searches, coding, data analysis and visualization. Participants will also learn and engage in discussions on data governance, the ethical and regulatory considerations of AI and the usage of advanced analytics platforms in healthcare settings.

## Objectives

-   Demonstrate innovative uses of AI by bioinformaticians in diverse applications, including AI-assisted coding, clinical informatics, experimental design optimisation, analysis of imaging and enterprise data among others.
-   Engage in practical sessions to utilize generative AI tools aimed at enhancing bioinformatics research.
-   Learn key considerations in data governance and the ethical implications of AI and the use of advanced analytics platforms.
-   Foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among participants to build a network of professionals interested in innovative AI applications.
