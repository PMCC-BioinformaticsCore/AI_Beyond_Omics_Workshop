    "text": "Workshop Summary\nThis workshop aims to explore the broad applications of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that are relevant to bioinformaticians. The event will feature short talks where participants will present projects that demonstrate the use of AI, beyond its applications in mainstream bioinformatics. These projects may involve various AI subfields, such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, computer vision, generative AI, natural language processing, neural networks, large language models (LLMs). The workshop will include a hands-on session focused on employing generative AI tools to augment bioinformatics research with particular emphasis on literature searches, coding, data analysis and visualization. Participants will also learn and engage in discussions on data governance, the ethical and regulatory considerations of AI and the usage of advanced analytics platforms in healthcare settings."
